# Notes on exercise counter project

Biggest question: Might it get global?

## Use Cases
- Personal app mobile/web
    * Statistics
    * Prepared training plans
    * Custom training plans
    * Hire remote trainer
    * Social - friends, share, challenges
- For Gym
    * Gym vs. Gym challenges - boards in gym, monthly rankings, ....
    * Equipment statistics - maintenance, lifetime

## System Equipment for Gyms
- Several DeepLenses 
    * ?5-10? per small-mid gym
    * self setup, registration and management via admin interface (with view area to machine/exercise editation)
    * might get global easier than solution below
- IP cameras + Servers to process 
    * probably more reliable
    * would need partners around the globe
    * worse installation and maintenance
- IP cameras / DeepLenses send to AWS
    * probably moste expansive operation
- thousands $ investments

## Operations
- Lifetime of Cameras (2 years, in doubt)
- Disturbances
- Cloud / Backend costs

## Monetization
- Personal Subscriptions
- Prepared training plans
- Maybe share from hiring remote trainers
- Fee from Gyms for equipment statistics
- HUGE ammount of data for training other models
- ?Connected shop with equipment?
